AgriChain – Farm-to-Market Intelligence Platform
Overview

AgriChain is an AI-powered Farm-to-Market Intelligence Platform designed to help Indian farmers reduce post-harvest losses and maximize profit. Research indicates that farmers lose up to 40% of their produce not due to poor cultivation, but due to poor timing of harvest, incorrect market selection, and post-harvest spoilage.

AgriChain provides data-driven recommendations by analyzing weather patterns, soil health indicators, historical mandi price data, storage conditions, and transit time. The platform generates clear, actionable guidance in plain language suitable for farmers using basic Android devices.

Problem Statement

Farmers often lack access to integrated decision support systems that combine:

Real-time weather information

Soil health data

Historical and current mandi price trends

Post-harvest storage and transportation risk factors

As a result, they may:

Harvest too early or too late

Sell in a suboptimal market

Experience preventable spoilage losses

Miss opportunities for higher revenue

AgriChain addresses this gap through predictive analytics and explainable AI.
