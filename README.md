## 🚩 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack access to integrated decision-support systems that combine:

- Real-time weather information

As a result, they may:

- Harvest too early or too late  
- Sell in a suboptimal market

- Miss opportunities for higher revenue  

AgriChain bridges this gap using **predictive analytics and explainable AI**.
